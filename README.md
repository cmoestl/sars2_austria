# sars2_austria

Simple python data analysis for SARS2 in Austria or any other country with a jupyter notebook or script, in comparison to South Korea.
This is **not a prediction**, but for monitoring data in comparison to an exponential fit and a country like South Korea which is a few weeks ahead in time compared to Europe.

Total case numbers and their start and end dates can be set in the file:

    set_input_here.py
    
The times and case numbers for Austria are given as default. Please open this file in a text editor and adjust it for the data in your country.

    python plot_cases.py
    
or open jupyter lab with     

    jupyter lab plot_cases.ipynb
    
and choose "run all cells" from the menu after jupyter lab opens in a browser.    

The name of the plot file that is produced can be adjusted in *set_input_here.py*.

For converting the jupyter notebook to a script on the command line do: 

    jupyter nbconvert --to script plot_cases.ipynb
